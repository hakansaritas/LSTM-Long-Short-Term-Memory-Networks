# LSTM - Long Short Term Memory Networks

* LSTM is a special type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that remembers values at random intervals and can learn long-term dependencies.
* It is commonly used for regression and time series classification and forecasting in machine learning. It can memorize data for long periods, which differentiates LSTM neural networks from other neural networks.
* LSTM Applications examp:Text Generation, Handwriting Recognition, Handwriting Production, Music Production..etc

* To better understand and deeply focus on LSTM I used last 5 years stock market data of 'AAPL', 'GOOG', 'MSFT', 'AMZN' companies.

* **AIM**: Predict the Close 

* Independent Variables are :
    - Date
    - Open
    - Adj Close
    - Volume
    - Company
* Dependent Variable and target
    - Close
